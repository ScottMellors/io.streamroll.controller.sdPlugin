# StreamRoll.io - Elgato Streamdeck Plugin

This is a plugin for the Elgato Streamdeck enabling users to setup repeatable dice rolls for the [Streamroll.io](https://streamroll.io) app and control them at their finger tips.

## How it works

After users are logged in on the [StreamRoll website](https://streamroll.io), they will be given a UUID. This will be required for the streamdeck app to function. Enter this value on the button settings! Set the dice values you want the button pre

## Getting the app

You can access the [releases](https://github.com/ScottMellors/io.streamroll.controller.sdPlugin/releases/) manually to download the plugin, or (when its available) on the Streamdeck store, allows updates to be downloaded automatically!

## Manually updating the app

At some point you may need to reinstall the app, if the new .streamDeckPlugin doesn't work, you will need to remove it from your plugins folder in **C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins** or for Mac Users **~/Library/Application Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/Plugins/**. Just delete the *io.streamroll.controller.sdPlugin* and restart the streamdeck app.
